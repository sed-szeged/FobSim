# FobSim

This project aims to introduce a reliable Fog-enhanced Blockchain simulation environment, namely FoBSim.

This environment shall facilitate easy simulation for different Fog-Blockchain integration scenarios.

FoBSim is implemented using Python 3.8.

*The components implemented in FoBSim contains:

1- Fog layer implementation.

2- Blockchain network Implementation.

3- End-User layer implemetation.

4- Consensus algorithms.

5- Incentivization Mechanisms.

6- Parallel Mining.

7- Gossip Protocol.

8- Easy network topology and unique identities management.

*FoBSim allows the placement of the Blockchain network in either:

1- The Fog layer.

2- The End-User layer.

*The Blockchain in FoBSim provides the following services/immutable distributed ledgers:

1- Payment/Trading

2- Data management

3- Identity management

4- Computational Services through Smart Contracts

*The Blockchain in FoBSim allows the use of one of the following Consensus algorithms during each run:

1- Proof-of-Work (PoW)

2- Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

3- Proof-of-Authority (PoA)
